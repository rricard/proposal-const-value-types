      <h1>The Record Type</h1>
      <p>
        The Record type is the set of all finite mappings from Strings to ECMAScript primitive values including Record and Tuple. Each record value holds an associated [[Fields]] List value which is a list of pairs of the form { [[Key]], [[Value]] } where the [[Key]] is a String and [[Value]] is any primitive value. Entries of [[Fields]] are sorted by [[Key]] in code unit order. The [[Fields]] List and its entries are never modified.

        <h1>MakeRecordValue ( _keysList_, _valuesList_ )</h1>
        <p>This abstract operation MakeRecordValue takes a _keysList_ and a _valuesList_ argument. It is used to specify the creation of new Record value types. It performs the following steps when called:</p>
        <emu-alg>
            1. Assert: _keysList_ is a List of Strings.
            1. Assert: _valuesList_ is a List of primitive values.
            1. Assert: _valuesList_.length == _keysList_.length
            1. Let _entries_ be an empty List.
            1. For each _i_ from 0 to _keysList_.length:
              1. Add { [[Key]]: _keysList_[_i_], [[Value]]: _valuesList_[_i_] } to _entries_
            1. Let _sortedEntries_ be a new List containing the same values as the list _entries_ where the values are ordered as if an Array of the same values had been sorted using `Array.prototype.sort` using *undefined* as _comparefn_.
            1. Let _R_ be an empty Record
            1. Set _R_.[[Field]] to _sortedEntries_
            1. Return _R_

    <emu-clause id="sec-ecmascript-language-types-tuple-type">
      <h1>The Tuple Type</h1>
      <p>
        The Tuple type is the set of all finite and ordered sequences of ECMAScript primitive values including Record and Tuple. Each tuple value holds an associated [[Sequence]] List which is a list of primitive values. The [[Sequence]] List is integer-indexed.

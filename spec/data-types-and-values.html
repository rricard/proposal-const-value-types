      <h1>The Record Type</h1>
      <p>
        The Record type is the set of all finite mappings from Strings to ECMAScript primitive values including Record and Tuple. Each record value holds an associated [[Fields]] List value which is a list of pairs of the form { [[Key]], [[Value]] } where the [[Key]] is a String and [[Value]] is any primitive value. Entries of [[Fields]] are sorted by [[Key]] in code unit order. The [[Fields]] List and its entries are never modified.

        <h1>MakeRecordValue ( _entries_ )</h1>
        <p>This abstract operation MakeRecordValue takes a _entries_ argument. It is used to specify the creation of new Record value types. It performs the following steps when called:</p>
        <emu-alg>
            1. Assert: _entries_ is a List.
            1. Let _reversedEntries_ be _entries_ in reverse.
            1. Let _uniqueEntries_ be an empty List.
            1. For each _kv_ in _reversedEntries_:
              1. Assert: Type(_kv_.[[Key]]) is String.
              1. Assert: Type(_kv_.[[Value]]) is not Object.
              1. If there is no entry _existing_ in _uniqueEntries_ such that _existing_.[[Key]] is _kv_.[[Key]], append _kv_ to _uniqueEntries_.
            1. Let _sortedEntries_ be _uniqueEntries_ sorted such that, for any entry two entries _a_ preceding _b_, then the result of performing Abstract Relational Comparison _a_.[[Key]] < _b_.[[Key]] is *true*.
            1. Let _R_ be a Record value whose [[Fields]] value is _sortedEntries_.
            1. Return _R_.

    <emu-clause id="sec-ecmascript-language-types-tuple-type">
      <h1>The Tuple Type</h1>
      <p>
        The Tuple type is the set of all finite and ordered sequences of ECMAScript primitive values including Record and Tuple. Each tuple value holds an associated [[Sequence]] List which is a list of primitive values. The [[Sequence]] List is integer-indexed. The [[Sequence]] List and its values are never modified.

          1. Let _T_ be a Tuple value whose [[Sequence]] value is _values_
